# Introduction

This webpage was originally designed to host all of my work for the [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenge. 

However, as a data scientist, I often need a quick workspace to host all my other statistical analytics. Hence, as my analytical interests are not limited to just tidytuesday datasets, I also use this repo to host a whole range RMarkdown HTML reports. 

This webpage was deployed through GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages and divided into years. 


# 2020 Jan 03 - bushfire

This is not a fun exercise. I live in Australia and Australia is now hit with unprecedented number of bushfires. My house is about 30 mins drive from the nearest bushfire this week. I grabbed the NASA - FIRMS data and made a visualisation of the spread of bushfire around my house in the past 30 days. 

See [here](bushfire/NASA_FIRMS.html) for the RMarkdown generated HTML document.
