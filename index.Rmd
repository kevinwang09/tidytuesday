# Introduction

This webpage was originally designed to host all of my work for the [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenge. 

However, as a data scientist, I often need a quick workspace to host all my other statistical analytics. Hence, as my analytical interests are not limited to just tidytuesday datasets, I also use this repo to host a whole range RMarkdown HTML reports. 

This webpage was deployed through GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages and divided into years. 

# 2021-03-23 UNvotes

Codes are available [here](2021-03-23-UNvotes/UNvotes.html).

This dataset is on the voting records of countries in United Nations. The main question that I was interested in answering were, which countries had similar voting patterns in the past and how have those shifted and changed over the years. 

The main method used here is time series clustering on the percentage of times that a country has voted yes across all issues raised at the UN. 

What I learnt: 

+ `funFEM` can be a great package for functional clustering. However, setting up the basis functions and the number of clusters requires a bit of exploration, as there will be degeneracy if the two numbers are too close to each other. 
+ Doing similar exercise in Python actually made me realise how consistent the `tidyverse` is when wrangling data. 

Main findings: 

+ United States had increasing higher percentage of non-yes votes (i.e. voting either no or abstain). See cluster 6. 
+ Former Soviet states voted quite consistently in the past, however, have since diverged. See cluster 4. 
+ A number of European countries showed very similar voting patterns. Interestingly, Australia and New Zealand are also in this group. See cluster 3 and 8. 
+ South American countries are clustered together in cluster 5 and Middle Eastern countries (along with China) are in cluster 12.
