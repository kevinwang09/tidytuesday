# 2020 Jan 03 - bushfire

This was not a fun exercise. I live in Australia and Australia is now hit with unprecedented number of bushfires. My house is about 30 mins drive from the nearest bushfire this week. I grabbed the NASA - FIRMS data and made a visualisation of the spread of bushfire around my house in the past 30 days. 

See [here](bushfire/NASA_FIRMS.html) for the RMarkdown generated HTML document.
