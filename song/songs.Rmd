# Simulation problem

Initialise ($t = 1$) : every song has $1/n$ probability of being selected. 

Step $t = t$: if a song is selected $k$ times, the probability of this song being selected $(k + 1)/(n + t - 1)$.

What is the asymptotie behaviour of this?


```{r}
set.seed(1)
n = 100
maxt = 100000
p = rep(1/n, n)
k = rep(1, n)

for(t in seq_len(maxt)){
  # print(t)
  # p %>% round(2) %>% print()
  selected = sample(seq_len(n), 1, prob = p)
  # selected %>% print
  k[selected] = k[selected] + 1
  # print(k)
  p = k/(n + t)
  # print(sum(k))
}

hist(p, breaks = 20)
```
