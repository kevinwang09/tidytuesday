# What is this?

Main gallery: https://kevinwang09.github.io/tidytuesday

This repo was originally designed to host all of my work for the [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) challenge. 

However, as a data scientist, I often need a quick workspace to host all my other statistical analytics. Hence, as my analytical interests are not limited to just tidytuesday datasets, I also use this repo to host a whole range RMarkdown HTML reports. 

This webpage was deployed through GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

# Why am I doing this?

This repo is a part of a portfolio to demostrate my work, the main personal webpage being https://kevinwang09.github.io/. 
  
  1. Create a repository of code snippets. Due to the ethics restriction associated with my research, I cannot always share codes from my own research but once I re-apply the codes to a novel dataset, I can then share this here. 
  2. Learn efficient coding and reporting. I typically only set aside a few hours a week to complete these challenges. I want to make sure that I can code in a reproducible way (all data and codes are self-contained in this repo!) and have something meaningful every week. 
  3. Building up a data repository for teaching. During my PhD program at the University of Sydney, I also did casual lecturing. Having access to a repository of data that I understand and work on is very helpful for my own teaching. 
  4. Learn more about new packages and technologies. I am the kind of person who sees a hammer and tries to find a nail to hit. Everytime I learn about something, I want to quickly experience with it to get a quick understanding of it. This helps me to remember such a tool if I need it for my future work.
